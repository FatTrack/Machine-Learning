## Introduction Project
Fat Track (Food Analysis Tool for Tracking Calories and Carbohydrates) is a mobile application designed to help users track their calorie and nutrient intake by analyzing food images. With the help of AI and image processing technology, users can take pictures of their meals and instantly receive nutritional information such as calorie counts. The app aims to promote healthier eating habits, raise awareness about balanced nutrition, and improve overall well-being, particularly in Indonesia, where awareness of proper nutrition is often limited.
